/**
 * This class is used to represent the state of the game after applying one of the avaiable actions. It will also
 * track the A* specific information such as the parent pointer and the cost and heuristic function. Remember that
 * unlike the path planning A* from the first assignment the cost of an action may be more than 1. Specifically the cost
 * of executing a compound action such as move can be more than 1. You will need to account for this in your heuristic
 * and your cost function.
 *
 * The first instance is constructed from the StateView object (like in PA2). Implement the methods provided and
 * add any other methods and member variables you need.
 *
 * Some useful API calls for the state view are
 *
 * state.getXExtent() and state.getYExtent() to get the map size
 *
  * Note that SEPIA saves the townhall as a unit. Therefore when you create a GameState instance,
 * you must be able to distinguish the townhall from a peasant. This can be done by getting
 * the name of the unit type from that unit's TemplateView:
 * state.getUnit(id).getTemplateView().getName().toLowerCase(): returns "townhall" or "peasant"
 * 
 * You will also need to distinguish between gold mines and trees.
 * state.getResourceNode(id).getType(): returns the type of the given resource
 * 
 * You can compare these types to values in the ResourceNode.Type enum:
 * ResourceNode.Type.GOLD_MINE and ResourceNode.Type.TREE
 * 
 * You can check how much of a resource is remaining with the following:
 * state.getResourceNode(id).getAmountRemaining()
 *
 * I recommend storing the actions that generated the instance of the GameState in this class using whatever
 * class/structure you use to represent actions.
